You are welcome to make changes to the deepbloq.org website. 

You might want to include your pool, add your exchange, add some documentation, fix a typo, or something else.

### Step 1
Fork [this repository](https://github.com/Blockrazor/deepbloq.org).

If you have already edited something here before, you need to fetch the latest changes from upstream. The easiest way to do this is delete your fork and fork it again.

### Step 2
Open your fork on Github and edit any page you want. 

In order for us to merge your commit so that your changes are displayed on deepbloq.org you need to comply with the [C4 contribution protocol](https://github.com/socialarchitecture/protocols/blob/master/SAIP1.MD). You can read all the rules, but here's what you need to know:
1. Each edit that you commit (save) must be the solution to ONE identifiable problem,
2. Github will ask you for a commit message when you "save" your changes. The content of this commit must be less than 50 characters (github will tell you if it goes over). It must start with `problem: ` and then briefly describe the problem you are solving. For example `problem: my pool is not listed`. The body of the commit message must contain a description of the solution. For example `solution: added my pool to README.md`

The problem must be real, and the solution must the the simplest possible solution to the problem.

### Step 3
Creat a new pull request through Github. It should be fairly easy to work out how to do this but Google for it if you are having trouble.

### Step 4
If you followed the above instructions, your changes **will** be merged.
