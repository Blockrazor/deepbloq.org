### ALL information about EVERY blockchain project, clearly expressed.
DeepBloq aims to:
1. Gather ALL information about ALL blockchain projects. *Information*: anything knowable - much of this information is in people's minds, and not available over an API. *Blockchain projects*: if there's a token of any kind, it falls within this scope. The validity and accuracy of this information must be determined in order to satisfy this goal.
2. Determine the criticality of each data point - what type(s) of data is most important and over what time scale?
3. Compare and contrast each data point sufficiently enough to express ALL information in a way that makes sense to ANYONE, no matter what their background is.

### This is a seemingly impossible goal, how can it be done?
Conway’s law and Amdahl’s law suggest that this level of pervasive and granular data collection and analysis can only be accomplished if it is done in a *completely* decentralised manner. For example, if someone needs to *verify* information before it can be published then the resulting number of approved verifiers needed to verify thousands of data points for 10,000+ blockchain projects is obviously prohibitive. This means everything must happen in a permissionless/decentralised/self organising manner. 

This is true of all aspects of the project. The problem is too large for a single human mind, but as the initiators of this project we believe that a hive-mind or collective intelligence approach will be able to solve it. Requiring *upfront consensus* before work can be done is a [blocking process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_(computing)), so it cannot scale and limits the size of the *hive mind* used to solve the problem. Thus, the "management" of the project must be done in a decentralised and permissionless manner as well. 

### Evolution vs Intelligent Design
The [C4](http://socialarchitecture.science/c4/) is essentially a hill-climbing algorithm, it has a life and direction of its own and doesn't require leadership - just enforcement of the protocol itself. 

It's akin to Evolution *vs.* Intelligent design; central planning *vs.* the free market. It may sound strange, but open source projects almost universally adopt some form of central command and control structure. The project founders or key developers decide what can and can't go into the project, and what the long term vision is. 

This is even more pronounced when it comes to cryptocurrencies, the idea seems to be that because they have value they're too important to trust anything but a centrally controlled development protocol - everything must be approved by the project leaders. It's impossible to entertain the idea of using an evolutionary approach because upfront consensus is incompatible with evolution. 

This unfortunately means that cryptocurrencies are *constantly fighting a battle against the forces behind Conway's law*.

### Direction, vision, and planning
The power of the C4 *cannot be overstated*. Human decisions about direction, vision, and planning are completely incompatible with the C4. Control is relinquished to a decentralized hill-climbing *protocol*. 

There's no evidence of any blockchain project attempting such a decentralized approach to development. DeepBloq is an experiment. It could be a raving success or it could be a complete failure.
